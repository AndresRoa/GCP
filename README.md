This repository contents the code for “Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project”, which takes as imput the text files from”” and output “tidyGC_project1.txt” which contain a data set ready to be studied. The code is in the file called “run_analysis.R”

ALGORITHm  FOR THE CODE
I have started by reading the data from the text files, and then taking those to proper form (data.tables) to work with ithem. Then I merged them by “test” and “train” creating one dataset. After this I set names to variables and merged columns to get the Data Frame. 

Then I only took measurements  on the mean and standard deviation and uses descrptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. Finally I wrote this last data table.
